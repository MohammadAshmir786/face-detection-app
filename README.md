## 🌟 Features
- 👤 **Real-time face detection** using the Haar Cascade Alt file.
- 📷 Works seamlessly with your **webcam**.
- 🖥️ **Simple and clean interface** for easy interaction.
- 🔧 **Easy setup** with minimal dependencies.
- 📜 **Detailed logging** to assist in debugging and error tracking.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **OpenCV library** 📦

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-app.git
   cd face-detection-app

2. **Install OpenCV:** You can install OpenCV using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Application:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and use the following command:
    ```bash
    python face_detection.py
- NOTE: If you are using a webcam, please make sure your webcam is connected and properly set up. 📷

2. **View the Output:** The application will launch a window showing the video stream from your webcam. Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles. 🔍

3. **Exit the Application:** Press the ESC key to close the application window. ❌

## 📝 Code Explanation
- **Haar Cascade Alt File:** A pre-trained file used to identify face-like patterns in real-time video streams.
- **FaceDetector Class:** Handles the initialization of the Haar Cascade classifier and webcam video feed.
- **capture_video Method:** Captures video frames, detects faces using the classifier, and displays the output.
- **Logging:** The application uses logging to provide feedback, error messages, and debug information.
